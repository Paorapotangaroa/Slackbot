Students often message in slack and request help from TAs. We have a Google Calendar and the TA hours are posted on the Course Page. In spite of that, many students still struggled to find the office hours for TAs which led to frustration and animosity between students and TAs.

This app is a potential solution as it makes it easy for students to find TA hours, responds 24/7, and requires no change in behavior from students. They can still send the same messages but now they will get a response with the next available TA time. This is an imporvement because TAs couldn't always respond with their next availablity because they were asleep, in class, etc.

It also requires no change in behavior for the TAs as they already used a Google Calendar to post their hours and now the slackbot simply reads that into slack.

This is designed to be run in Socket Mode because we needed a quick fix. Maybe someday down the road I'll rewrite it for HTTP mode.
